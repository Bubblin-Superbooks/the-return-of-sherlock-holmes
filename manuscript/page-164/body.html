You remember Hilton Cubitt, of the dancing men? He was to reach Liverpool Street at one-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance.&rdquo;</p><p>We had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was looking worried and depressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he, as he sank, like a wearied man, into an armchair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of design upon you, but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just killing your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure. She&rsquo;s wearing away under it&mdash;just wearing away before my eyes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
