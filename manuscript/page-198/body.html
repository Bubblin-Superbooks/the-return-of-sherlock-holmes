When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, so it is hard to judge. But it did seem very loud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sure I couldn&rsquo;t say, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather think, Inspector Martin, that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
