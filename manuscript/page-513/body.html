Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred?&rdquo;</p><p>The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an extraordinary thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that all my life I have been collecting other people&rsquo;s news, and now that a real piece of news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I can&rsquo;t put two words together. If I had come in here as a journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people, and I can make no use of it myself.
