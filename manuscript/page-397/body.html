<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You remember that a stonemason, named Slater, walking from Forest Row about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;two days before the murder&mdash;stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees. He swears that the shadow of a man&rsquo;s head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind, and that this shadow was certainly not that of Peter Carey, whom he knew well. It was that of a bearded man, but the beard was short and bristled forward in a way very different from that of the captain. So he says, but he had been two hours in the public-house, and it is some distance from the road to the window. Besides, this refers to the Monday, and the crime was done upon the Wednesday.</p></div> </div>
