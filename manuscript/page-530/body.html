<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The manager, a big blond German, received us civilly and gave a clear answer to all Holmes&rsquo;s questions. A reference to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of Devine&rsquo;s head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six should be different from any of the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them&mdash;in fact, he laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of Paris were joined together to make the complete bust. The work was usually done by Italians, in the room we were in.</p></div> </div>
