I implore you not to tell him that I came here.&rdquo; Holmes bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire, but I fear that I cannot make any unconditional promise.&rdquo;</p><p>She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window. It was a queenly presence&mdash;tall, graceful, and intensely womanly. &ldquo;Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and her white-gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;I will speak frankly to you in the hopes that it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That one is politics.</p></div> </div>
