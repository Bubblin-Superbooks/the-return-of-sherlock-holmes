<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Agatha&mdash;that&rsquo;s my fiancee&mdash;says it is a joke in the servants&rsquo; hall that it&rsquo;s impossible to wake the master. He has a secretary who is devoted to his interests, and never budges from the study all day. That&rsquo;s why we are going at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. I met Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run. This is the house, this big one in its own grounds. Through the gate&mdash;now to the right among the laurels. We might put on our masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
