It is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good evening.&rdquo;</p><p>When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes&rsquo;s movements were such as to rivet our attention.
