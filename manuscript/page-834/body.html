<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o&rsquo;clock this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his suggestion that we have both come to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you informed the police?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he was famous. &ldquo;We have not done so, nor is it possible that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why, sir?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
