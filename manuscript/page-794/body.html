<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as likely?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not? There was wine in each glass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. You must have noticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. There are two possible explanations, and only two. One is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the third glass received the beeswing. That does not appear probable. No, no, I am sure that I am right.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
