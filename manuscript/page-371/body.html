<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I could not acknowledge the paternity to the world, but I gave him the best of educations, and since he came to manhood I have kept him near my person. He surmised my secret, and has presumed ever since upon the claim which he has upon me, and upon his power of provoking a scandal which would be abhorrent to me. His presence had something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage. Above all, he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred. You may well ask me why, under these circumstances, I still kept James under my roof. I answer that it was because I could see his mother&rsquo;s face in his, and that for her dear sake there was no end to my long-suffering. All her pretty ways too&mdash;there was not one of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory. I could not send him away.</p></div> </div>
