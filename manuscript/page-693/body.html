<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at Baker Street, but I have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy February morning, some seven or eight years ago, and gave Mr. Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. It was addressed to him, and ran thus:</p><p>Please await me. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter missing, indispensable to-morrow. OVERTON.</p><p>&ldquo;Strand postmark, and dispatched ten thirty-six,&rdquo; said Holmes, reading it over and over. &ldquo;Mr. Overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it, and somewhat incoherent in consequence. Well, well, he will be here, I daresay, by the time I have looked through the Times, and then we shall know all about it. Even the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
