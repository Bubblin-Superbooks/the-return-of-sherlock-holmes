<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood with his back against the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. &ldquo;I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.&rdquo; He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door.</p></div> </div>
