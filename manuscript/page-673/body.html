<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A lady yesterday entered your study. She came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau. She had a key of her own. I have had an opportunity of examining yours, and I do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced. You were not an accessory, therefore, and she came, so far as I can read the evidence, without your knowledge to rob you.&rdquo;</p><p>The professor blew a cloud from his lips. &ldquo;This is most interesting and instructive,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you no more to add? Surely, having traced this lady so far, you can also say what has become of her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
