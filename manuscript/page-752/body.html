<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. Her calm pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid a great tangle of golden hair. At the foot of the bed, half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was a young man, whose frame was racked by his sobs. So absorbed was he by his bitter grief, that he never looked up until Holmes&rsquo;s hand was on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I am&mdash;but you are too late. She is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>The man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance.</p></div> </div>
