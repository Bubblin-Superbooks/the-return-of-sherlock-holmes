A servant entered.</p><p>&ldquo;You will be glad to hear,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;that your young master is found.

I am not in an official position, and there is no reason, so long as the ends of justice are served, why I should disclose all that I know. As to Hayes, I say nothing. The gallows awaits him, and I would do nothing to save him from it. What he will divulge I cannot tell, but I have no doubt that your Grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent.</p></div> </div>
