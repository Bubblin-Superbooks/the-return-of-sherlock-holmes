Well, perhaps I don&rsquo;t. But I am sure that it will interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex day&rsquo;s work before us. I should be glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o&rsquo;clock this evening. Until then I should like to keep this photograph, found in the dead man&rsquo;s pocket. It is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until then good-bye and good luck!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
