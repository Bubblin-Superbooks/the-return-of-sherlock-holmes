<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Hopkins.</p><p>&ldquo;But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking, did she not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; she was clear about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then there is an end of it. What more is to be said? And yet, you must admit, that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What? You see nothing remarkable? Well, well, let it pass. Perhaps, when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well, good-morning, Hopkins. I don&rsquo;t see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear to have your case very clear. You will let me know when Randall is arrested, and any further developments which may occur. I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
