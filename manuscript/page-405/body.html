I thought that &lsquo;J.H.N.&rsquo; were the initials of a broker, and that &lsquo;C.P.R.&rsquo; may have been his client.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try Canadian Pacific Railway,&rdquo; said Holmes.</p><p>Stanley Hopkins swore between his teeth, and struck his thigh with his clenched hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What a fool I have been!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Of course, it is as you say. Then &lsquo;J.H.N.&rsquo; are the only initials we have to solve. I have already examined the old Stock Exchange lists, and I can find no one in 1883, either in the house or among the outside brokers, whose initials correspond with these. Yet I feel that the clue is the most important one that I hold.</p></div> </div>
