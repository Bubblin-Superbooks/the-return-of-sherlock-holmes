<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;May I ask, in the meanwhile, whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old enough to look after himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself, I entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I quite understand your position,&rdquo; said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite understand mine. Godfrey Staunton appears to have been a poor man. If he has been kidnapped, it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses. The fame of your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-James, and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house, your habits, and your treasure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
