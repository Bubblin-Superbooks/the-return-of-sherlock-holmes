<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman standing over me in the hall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, who was the murdered man?&rdquo; asked Holmes.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to show who he was,&rdquo; said Lestrade. &ldquo;You shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
