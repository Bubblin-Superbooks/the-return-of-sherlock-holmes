<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Damn the beast, if he had as many lives as a cat, he would owe them all to me! But it&rsquo;s the lady, Mary&mdash;Mary Fraser&mdash;for never will I call her by that accursed name. When I think of getting her into trouble, I who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face, it&rsquo;s that that turns my soul into water. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;what less could I do? I&rsquo;ll tell you my story, gentlemen, and then I&rsquo;ll ask you, as man to man, what less could I do?</p><p>&ldquo;I must go back a bit. You seem to know everything, so I expect that you know that I met her when she was a passenger and I was first officer of the Rock of Gibraltar. From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me.</p></div> </div>
