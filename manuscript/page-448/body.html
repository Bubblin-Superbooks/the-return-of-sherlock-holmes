<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I found Patrick Cairns among the harpooners, my research was nearing its end. I argued that the man was probably in London, and that he would desire to leave the country for a time. I therefore spent some days in the East End, devised an Arctic expedition, put forth tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under Captain Basil&mdash;and behold the result!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried Hopkins. &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must obtain the release of young Neligan as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I confess that I think you owe him some apology. The tin box must be returned to him, but, of course, the securities which Peter Carey has sold are lost forever. There&rsquo;s the cab, Hopkins, and you can remove your man. If you want me for the trial, my address and that of Watson will be somewhere in Norway&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send particulars later.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
