These agents work independently, and their relations with the Embassies are often strained.&rdquo;</p><p>The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a prize to headquarters with his own hands. I think that your course of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
