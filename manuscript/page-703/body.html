This throws new light upon the matter. Lord Mount-James is one of the richest men in England.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard Godfrey say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And your friend was closely related?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly eighty&mdash;cram full of gout, too. They say he could chalk his billiard-cue with his knuckles. He never allowed Godfrey a shilling in his life, for he is an absolute miser, but it will all come to him right enough.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
