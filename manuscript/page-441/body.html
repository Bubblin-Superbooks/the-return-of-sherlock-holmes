<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So far as I know, the man&rsquo;s name was never mentioned, and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been. It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. Only one man knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for, with my own eyes, I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the Shetland Lights. Well, I kept my knowledge to myself, and waited to see what would come of it. When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and nobody asked any questions. A stranger died by accident and it was nobody&rsquo;s business to inquire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before I could find where he was.</p></div> </div>
