<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb. The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door.</p><p>&ldquo;What can he want?&rdquo; I ejaculated, as a man stepped out of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Want? He wants us. And we, my poor Watson, want overcoats and cravats and goloshes, and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather. Wait a bit, though! There&rsquo;s the cab off again! There&rsquo;s hope yet. He&rsquo;d have kept it if he had wanted us to come. Run down, my dear fellow, and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been long in bed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
