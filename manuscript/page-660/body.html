Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe? So estimable a young man! I assure you that, after a few months&rsquo; training, he was an admirable assistant. What do you think of the matter, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not yet made up my mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us. To a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralyzing. I seem to have lost the faculty of thought. But you are a man of action&mdash;you are a man of affairs. It is part of the everyday routine of your life. You can preserve your balance in every emergency. We are fortunate, indeed, in having you at our side.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
