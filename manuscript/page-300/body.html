He was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world. He has a deep horror of anything of the kind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But there has been some official investigation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and it has proved most disappointing. An apparent clue was at once obtained, since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train. Only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in Liverpool, and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand. Then it was that in my despair and disappointment, after a sleepless night, I came straight to you by the early train.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
