<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Holmes, I will tell you everything,&rdquo; cried the lady. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Holmes, I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of sorrow! There is no woman in all London who loves her husband as I do, and yet if he knew how I have acted&mdash;how I have been compelled to act&mdash;he would never forgive me. For his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. Help me, Mr. Holmes! My happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quick, madam, the time grows short!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a letter of mine, Mr. Holmes, an indiscreet letter written before my marriage&mdash;a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving girl. I meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal.</p></div> </div>
