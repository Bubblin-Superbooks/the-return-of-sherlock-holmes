<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Your secretary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir, my son.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Holmes&rsquo;s turn to look astonished.</p><p>&ldquo;I confess that this is entirely new to me, your Grace. I must beg you to be more explicit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will conceal nothing from you. I agree with you that complete frankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in this desperate situation to which James&rsquo;s folly and jealousy have reduced us. When I was a very young man, Mr. Holmes, I loved with such a love as comes only once in a lifetime. I offered the lady marriage, but she refused it on the grounds that such a match might mar my career. Had she lived, I would certainly never have married anyone else. She died, and left this one child, whom for her sake I have cherished and cared for.</p></div> </div>
