It may have been hidden somewhere, and the pair gone off on foot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not? Were there other bicycles in this shed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Several.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would he not have hidden a couple, had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose he would.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course he would. The blind theory won&rsquo;t do. But the incident is an admirable starting-point for an investigation. After all, a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy. One other question. Did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
