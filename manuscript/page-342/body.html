He had had one of those violent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless. With difficulty he limped up to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you, Mr. Reuben Hayes?&rdquo; said Holmes.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you, and how do you get my name so pat?&rdquo; the countryman answered, with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s printed on the board above your head. It&rsquo;s easy to see a man who is master of his own house. I suppose you haven&rsquo;t such a thing as a carriage in your stables?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
