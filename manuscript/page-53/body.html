<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;That you, Lestrade?&rdquo; said Holmes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It&rsquo;s good to see you back in London, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected murders in one year won&rsquo;t do, Lestrade.

Already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner.</p></div> </div>
