But that&rsquo;s nothing! I didn&rsquo;t think there was a soul in England who didn&rsquo;t know Godfrey Staunton, the crack three-quarter, Cambridge, Blackheath, and five Internationals. Good Lord!

My ramifications stretch out into many sections of society, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is the best and soundest thing in England.
