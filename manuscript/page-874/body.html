<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Surely it is final as regards the man&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s death is a mere incident&mdash;a trivial episode&mdash;in comparison with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a European catastrophe. Only one important thing has happened in the last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports almost hourly from the government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose&mdash;no, it can&rsquo;t be loose&mdash;but if it isn&rsquo;t loose, where can it be? Who has it? Why is it held back? That&rsquo;s the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why is it not among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?</p></div> </div>
