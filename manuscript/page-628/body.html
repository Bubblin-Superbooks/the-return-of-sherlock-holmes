<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was wired for at 3:15, reached Yoxley Old Place at 5, conducted my investigation, was back at Charing Cross by the last train, and straight to you by cab.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it. So far as I can see, it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn&rsquo;t go wrong. There&rsquo;s no motive, Mr. Holmes. That&rsquo;s what bothers me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t put my hand on a motive. Here&rsquo;s a man dead&mdash;there&rsquo;s no denying that&mdash;but, so far as I can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
