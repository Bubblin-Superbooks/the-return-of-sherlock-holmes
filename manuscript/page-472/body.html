Here, too, is my dark lantern. Everything is in order. Have you a pair of silent shoes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent! And a mask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can make a couple out of black silk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can see that you have a strong, natural turn for this sort of thing. Very good, do you make the masks. We shall have some cold supper before we start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive as far as Church Row. It is a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s walk from there to Appledore Towers. We shall be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy sleeper, and retires punctually at ten-thirty.</p></div> </div>
