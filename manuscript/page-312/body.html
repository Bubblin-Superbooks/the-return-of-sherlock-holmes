<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I agree with Mr. Wilder, Dr. Huxtable, that you would have done wisely to consult me. But since Mr. Holmes has already been taken into your confidence, it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services. Far from going to the inn, Mr. Holmes, I should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at Holdernesse Hall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank your Grace. For the purposes of my investigation, I think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just as you like, Mr. Holmes. Any information which Mr. Wilder or I can give you is, of course, at your disposal.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
