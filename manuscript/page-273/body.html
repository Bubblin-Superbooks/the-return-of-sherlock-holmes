Here, you!&rdquo; he shouted to a frightened groom, who had appeared at the edge of the glade. &ldquo;Come here. Take this note as hard as you can ride to Farnham.&rdquo; He scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook. &ldquo;Give it to the superintendent at the police-station. Until he comes, I must detain you all under my personal custody.&rdquo;</p><p>The strong, masterful personality of Holmes dominated the tragic scene, and all were equally puppets in his hands. Williamson and Carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded Woodley into the house, and I gave my arm to the frightened girl. The injured man was laid on his bed, and at Holmes&rsquo;s request I examined him.</p></div> </div>
