This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower-bed. I can&rsquo;t see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes: someone has passed along,&rdquo; said Holmes, stooping over the grass border. &ldquo;Our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
