<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, Watson, I simply can&rsquo;t leave that case in this condition. Every instinct that I possess cries out against it. It&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;it&rsquo;s all wrong&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear that it&rsquo;s wrong. And yet the lady&rsquo;s story was complete, the maid&rsquo;s corroboration was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. What have I to put up against that? Three wine-glasses, that is all. But if I had not taken things for granted, if I had examined everything with the care which I should have shown had we approached the case de novo and had no cut-and-dried story to warp my mind, should I not then have found something more definite to go upon? Of course I should.</p></div> </div>
