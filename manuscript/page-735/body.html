<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;John, show these gentlemen out!&rdquo; A pompous butler ushered us severely to the door, and we found ourselves in the street. Holmes burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have not seen a man who, if he turns his talents that way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious Moriarty. And now, my poor Watson, here we are, stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town, which we cannot leave without abandoning our case. This little inn just opposite Armstrong&rsquo;s house is singularly adapted to our needs. If you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for the night, I may have time to make a few inquiries.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
