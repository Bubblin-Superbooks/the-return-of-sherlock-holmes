<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man.</p><p>&ldquo;Next time I came back from sea, I heard of her marriage. Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t she marry whom she liked? Title and money&mdash;who could carry them better than she? She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty. I didn&rsquo;t grieve over her marriage. I was not such a selfish hound as that.</p></div> </div>
