Godfrey was not fond of the old man. He would not go if he could help it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we can soon determine that. If your friend was going to his relative, Lord Mount-James, you have then to explain the visit of this rough-looking fellow at so late an hour, and the agitation that was caused by his coming.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
