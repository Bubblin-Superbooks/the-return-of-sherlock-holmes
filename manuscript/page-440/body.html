Just sit me up a little, so as I can speak easy. It was in &lsquo;83 that it happened&mdash;August of that year. Peter Carey was master of the Sea Unicorn, and I was spare harpooner. We were coming out of the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a week&rsquo;s southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north. There was one man on her&mdash;a landsman. The crew had thought she would founder and had made for the Norwegian coast in the dinghy. I guess they were all drowned. Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. All the baggage we took off with him was one tin box.</p></div> </div>
