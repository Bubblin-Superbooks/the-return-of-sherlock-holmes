I heard that you had been down to the office. There was no getting away from you. Let&rsquo;s hear the worst. What are you going to do with me? Arrest me? Speak out, man! You can&rsquo;t sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give him a cigar,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Bite on that, Captain Crocker, and don&rsquo;t let your nerves run away with you. I should not sit here smoking with you if I thought that you were a common criminal, you may be sure of that. Be frank with me and we may do some good. Play tricks with me, and I&rsquo;ll crush you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
