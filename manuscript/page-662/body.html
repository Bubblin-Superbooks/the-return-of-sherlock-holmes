I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity. It was evident that he shared our host&rsquo;s liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;That is my magnum opus&mdash;the pile of papers on the side table yonder. It is my analysis of the documents found in the Coptic monasteries of Syria and Egypt, a work which will cut deep at the very foundation of revealed religion.
