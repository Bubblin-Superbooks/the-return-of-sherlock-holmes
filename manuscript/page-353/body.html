We had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road. Amid a rolling cloud of dust, I caught a glimpse of a pale, agitated face&mdash;a face with horror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes staring wildly in front. It was like some strange caricature of the dapper James Wilder whom we had seen the night before.</p><p>&ldquo;The Duke&rsquo;s secretary!&rdquo; cried Holmes. &ldquo;Come, Watson, let us see what he does.&rdquo;</p><p>We scrambled from rock to rock, until in a few moments we had made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn. Wilder&rsquo;s bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. No one was moving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows.</p></div> </div>
