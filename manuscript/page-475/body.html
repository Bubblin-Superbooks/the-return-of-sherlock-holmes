<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most truculent figures in London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house. A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several windows and two doors.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his bedroom,&rdquo; Holmes whispered. &ldquo;This door opens straight into the study. It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked, and we should make too much noise getting in. Come round here. There&rsquo;s a greenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p><p>The place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside. An instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. The thick, warm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat.</p></div> </div>
