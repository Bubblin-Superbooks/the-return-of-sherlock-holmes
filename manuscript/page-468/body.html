<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the detection, the capture, the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious Milverton.</p><p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Holmes, think what you are doing,&rdquo; I cried.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. I am never precipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and, indeed, so dangerous a course, if any other were possible. Let us look at the matter clearly and fairly. I suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. To burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocketbook&mdash;an action in which you were prepared to aid me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
