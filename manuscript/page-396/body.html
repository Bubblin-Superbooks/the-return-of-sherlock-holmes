<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He had built himself a wooden outhouse&mdash;he always called it the &lsquo;cabin&rsquo;&mdash;a few hundred yards from his house, and it was here that he slept every night. It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by ten. He kept the key in his pocket, made his own bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold. There are small windows on each side, which were covered by curtains and never opened. One of these windows was turned towards the high road, and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what Black Peter was doing in there. That&rsquo;s the window, Mr. Holmes, which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest.</p></div> </div>
