I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night. It was before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is, sir. You will see that I have said, &lsquo;I have determined not to go in for the examination. I have been offered a commission in the Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to South Africa at once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage,&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;But why did you change your purpose?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
