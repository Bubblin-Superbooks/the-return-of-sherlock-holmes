<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer&rsquo;s establishment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery manner.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What we pay rates and taxes for I don&rsquo;t know, when any ruffian can come in and break one&rsquo;s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I make it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues. Red republicans&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I call &lsquo;em. Who did I get the statues from? I don&rsquo;t see what that has to do with it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and have been this twenty years.</p></div> </div>
