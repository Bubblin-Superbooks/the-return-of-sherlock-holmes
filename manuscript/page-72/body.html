<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well known man so much older than himself. Probably he acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. He therefore murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his partner&rsquo;s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins. Will it pass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
