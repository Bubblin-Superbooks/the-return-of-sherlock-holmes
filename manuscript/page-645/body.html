<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Wanted, a woman of good address, attired like a lady. She has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably rounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. As her glasses are of remarkable strength, and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.&rdquo;</p><p>Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been reflected upon my features. &ldquo;Surely my deductions are simplicity itself,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as these.</p></div> </div>
