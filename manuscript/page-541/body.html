<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;In the Italian Quarter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I&rsquo;ll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours&rsquo; sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o&rsquo;clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You&rsquo;ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is important that it should go at once.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
