I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had been taken out and left on the table. The papers had been made up into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the police. They were not, so far as I could judge, of any great value, nor did the bank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances. But it seemed to me that all the papers were not there. There were allusions to some deeds&mdash;possibly the more valuable&mdash;which I could not find. This, of course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade&rsquo;s argument against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit it?</p></div> </div>
