<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes&rsquo;s face showed his disappointment and annoyance.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, we can&rsquo;t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;We must come back in the afternoon, if Mr. Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light upon the problem.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
