<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.</p><p>The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth, at that time governor of one of the Australian colonies. Adair&rsquo;s mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427 Park Lane. The youth moved in the best society&mdash;had, so far as was known, no enemies and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest {sic} the man&rsquo;s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional.</p></div> </div>
