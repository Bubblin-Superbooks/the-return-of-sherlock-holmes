The future will show which is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes: that so far as we know, none of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for removing them, since he was heir-at-law, and would come into them in any case.&rdquo;</p><p>My friend seemed struck by this remark.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I only wish to point out that there are other theories possible. As you say, the future will decide. Good-morning! I dare say that in the course of the day I shall drop in at Norwood and see how you are getting on.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
