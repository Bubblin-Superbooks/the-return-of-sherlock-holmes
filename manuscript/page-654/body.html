I forgot to tell you that Mrs. Marker, the housekeeper, had been in there tidying not very long before&mdash;about a quarter of an hour, she says.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that gives us a limit.

If there had been anything worth her taking, it would surely have been locked up. No, it was for something in that wooden bureau. Halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it?
