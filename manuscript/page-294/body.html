I am aware, Mr. Holmes, that you take a very high line in professional matters, and that you are prepared to work for the work&rsquo;s sake. I may tell you, however, that his Grace has already intimated that a check for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is, and another thousand to him who can name the man or men who have taken him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a princely offer,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Watson, I think that we shall accompany Dr. Huxtable back to the north of England. And now, Dr. Huxtable, when you have consumed that milk, you will kindly tell me what has happened, when it happened, how it happened, and, finally, what Dr. Thorneycroft Huxtable, of the Priory School, near Mackleton, has to do with the matter, and why he comes three days after an event&mdash;the state of your chin gives the date&mdash;to ask for my humble services.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
