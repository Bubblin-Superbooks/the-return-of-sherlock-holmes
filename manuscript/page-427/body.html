He sank his face in his hands, and trembled all over.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I did not know. I thought I had lost it at the hotel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said Hopkins, sternly. &ldquo;Whatever else you have to say, you must say in court. You will walk down with me now to the police-station. Well, Mr. Holmes, I am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me. As it turns out your presence was unnecessary, and I would have brought the case to this successful issue without you, but, none the less, I am grateful. Rooms have been reserved for you at the Brambletye Hotel, so we can all walk down to the village together.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
