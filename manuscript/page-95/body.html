Lestrade had learned by more experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously at my companion.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables are at the door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting.&rdquo; The wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from the room. The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained.</p></div> </div>
