We&rsquo;re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow, there&rsquo;s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn&rsquo;t be glad to shake you by the hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; and as he turned away, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more. &ldquo;Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade.</p></div> </div>
