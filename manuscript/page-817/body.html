<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To give me a true account of all that happened at the Abbey Grange last night&mdash;a true account, mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken off. I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight, I&rsquo;ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands forever.&rdquo;</p><p>The sailor thought for a little. Then he struck his leg with his great sunburned hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I believe you are a man of your word, and a white man, and I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story. But one thing I will say first. So far as I am concerned, I regret nothing and I fear nothing, and I would do it all again and be proud of the job.</p></div> </div>
