<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When Lord Saltire&rsquo;s disappearance was discovered, I at once called a roll of the whole establishment&mdash;boys, masters, and servants. It was then that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not been alone in his flight. Heidegger, the German master, was missing. His room was on the second floor, at the farther end of the building, facing the same way as Lord Saltire&rsquo;s. His bed had also been slept in, but he had apparently gone away partly dressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor. He had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn. His bicycle was kept in a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was gone.</p></div> </div>
