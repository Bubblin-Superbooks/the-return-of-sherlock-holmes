Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at all. To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you! With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity, you have got him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain&mdash;Colonel Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor front of No. 427 Park Lane, upon the thirtieth of last month. That&rsquo;s the charge, Lestrade.</p></div> </div>
