I don&rsquo;t think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it&rsquo;s a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our ears.</p></div> </div>
