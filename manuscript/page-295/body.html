<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;On May 1st the boy arrived, that being the beginning of the summer term. He was a charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. I may tell you&mdash;I trust that I am not indiscreet, but half-confidences are absurd in such a case&mdash;that he was not entirely happy at home. It is an open secret that the Duke&rsquo;s married life had not been a peaceful one, and the matter had ended in a separation by mutual consent, the Duchess taking up her residence in the south of France. This had occurred very shortly before, and the boy&rsquo;s sympathies are known to have been strongly with his mother. He moped after her departure from Holdernesse Hall, and it was for this reason that the Duke desired to send him to my establishment. In a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us and was apparently absolutely happy.</p></div> </div>
