<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking you. You&rsquo;re in her dog-cart. You ought to know where she is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We met the dog-cart on the road. There was no one in it. We drove back to help the young lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Good Lord! What shall I do?&rdquo; cried the stranger, in an ecstasy of despair. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got her, that hell-hound Woodley and the blackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you really are her friend. Stand by me and we&rsquo;ll save her, if I have to leave my carcass in Charlington Wood.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
