<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Theresa was as cool as ice, and it was her plot as much as mine. We must make it appear that burglars had done the thing. Theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress, while I swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. Then I lashed her in her chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural, else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it. Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to carry out the idea of the robbery, and there I left them, with orders to give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s start. I dropped the silver into the pond, and made off for Sydenham, feeling that for once in my life I had done a real good night&rsquo;s work. And that&rsquo;s the truth and the whole truth, Mr. Holmes, if it costs me my neck.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
