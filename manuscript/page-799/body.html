He was cunning enough to do that with his knife. But the other end is not frayed. You could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever. You can reconstruct what occurred. The man needed the rope. He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket&mdash;you will see the impression in the dust&mdash;and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by at least three inches&mdash;from which I infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than I. Look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! What is it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
