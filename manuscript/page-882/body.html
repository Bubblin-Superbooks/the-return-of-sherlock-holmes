<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don&rsquo;t do it before us. We&rsquo;ll wait here. You take him into the back room. You&rsquo;ll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room. Don&rsquo;t ask him if he has done it. Take it for granted. Tell him you know someone has been here. Press him. Tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness. Do exactly what I tell you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By George, if he knows I&rsquo;ll have it out of him!&rdquo; cried Lestrade. He darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room.</p></div> </div>
