I sent the paper on ahead, so that you might have time to study it before I came.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is certainly rather a curious production,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;At first sight it would appear to be some childish prank. It consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn.
