I found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to Norway. The autumn of that year was a stormy one, and there was a long succession of southerly gales. My father&rsquo;s yacht may well have been blown to the north, and there met by Captain Peter Carey&rsquo;s ship. If that were so, what had become of my father? In any case, if I could prove from Peter Carey&rsquo;s evidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them, and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them.</p></div> </div>
