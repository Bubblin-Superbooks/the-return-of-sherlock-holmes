But I suppose you want us to come out to-morrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes. There&rsquo;s a train from Charing Cross to Chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley Old Place between eight and nine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then we shall take it. Your case has certainly some features of great interest, and I shall be delighted to look into it. Well, it&rsquo;s nearly one, and we had best get a few hours&rsquo; sleep. I daresay you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire. I&rsquo;ll light my spirit lamp, and give you a cup of coffee before we start.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
