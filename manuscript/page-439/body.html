<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;See here, mister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I make no complaint of being man-handled in this fashion, but I would have you call things by their right names. You say I murdered Peter Carey, I say I killed Peter Carey, and there&rsquo;s all the difference. Maybe you don&rsquo;t believe what I say. Maybe you think I am just slinging you a yarn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Let us hear what you have to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s soon told, and, by the Lord, every word of it is truth. I knew Black Peter, and when he pulled out his knife I whipped a harpoon through him sharp, for I knew that it was him or me. That&rsquo;s how he died. You can call it murder.</p></div> </div>
