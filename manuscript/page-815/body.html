I dare say you thought I acted rather badly to Stanley Hopkins just now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I trust your judgment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A very sensible reply, Watson. You must look at it this way: what I know is unofficial, what he knows is official. I have the right to private judgment, but he has none. He must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. In a doubtful case I would not put him in so painful a position, and so I reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But when will that be?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
