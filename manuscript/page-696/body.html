<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down to Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes. I saw Inspector Stanley Hopkins. He advised me to come to you. He said the case, so far as he could see, was more in your line than in that of the regular police.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful, Mr. Holmes&mdash;simply awful I wonder my hair isn&rsquo;t gray. Godfrey Staunton&mdash;you&rsquo;ve heard of him, of course? He&rsquo;s simply the hinge that the whole team turns on. I&rsquo;d rather spare two from the pack, and have Godfrey for my three-quarter line. Whether it&rsquo;s passing, or tackling, or dribbling, there&rsquo;s no one to touch him, and then, he&rsquo;s got the head, and can hold us all together. What am I to do? That&rsquo;s what I ask you, Mr. Holmes.</p></div> </div>
