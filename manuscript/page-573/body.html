<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case. &ldquo;Fortune has been your friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long&mdash;not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at my wit&rsquo;s end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help me, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma.</p></div> </div>
