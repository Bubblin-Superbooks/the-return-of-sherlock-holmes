There is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But James knew nothing of that. You cannot hold him responsible for that. It was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must take the view, your Grace, that when a man embarks upon a crime, he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morally, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. But surely not in the eyes of the law. A man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present, and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do.
