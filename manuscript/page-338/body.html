The natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him. He would know that he could overtake him. But the German does not do so. He turns to his bicycle. I am told that he was an excellent cyclist. He would not do this, if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The other bicycle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us continue our reconstruction. He meets his death five miles from the school&mdash;not by a bullet, mark you, which even a lad might conceivably discharge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm. The lad, then, had a companion in his flight. And the flight was a swift one, since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them.</p></div> </div>
