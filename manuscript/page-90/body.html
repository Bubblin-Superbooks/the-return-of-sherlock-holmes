But I was still more astonished when he told me the object of his visit. He had in his hand several sheets of a notebook, covered with scribbled writing&mdash;here they are&mdash;and he laid them on my table.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here is my will,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape. I will sit here while you do so.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment when I found that, with some reservations, he had left all his property to me. He was a strange little ferret-like man, with white eyelashes, and when I looked up at him I found his keen gray eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression.</p></div> </div>
