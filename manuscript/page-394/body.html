<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Stanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man, Captain Peter Carey. He was born in &lsquo;45&mdash;fifty years of age. He was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher. In 1883 he commanded the steam sealer Sea Unicorn, of Dundee. He had then had several successful voyages in succession, and in the following year, 1884, he retired. After that he travelled for some years, and finally he bought a small place called Woodman&rsquo;s Lee, near Forest Row, in Sussex. There he has lived for six years, and there he died just a week ago to-day.</p></div> </div>
