<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I see. You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Possibly an accident, possibly&mdash;I only breathe it among ourselves&mdash;a suicide. Young men have their hidden troubles&mdash;some affair of the heart, perhaps, which we have never known.

I cannot explain the practical things of life. But still, we are aware, my friend, that love-gages may take strange shapes. By all means take another cigarette. It is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so. A fan, a glove, glasses&mdash;who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life? This gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass, but, after all, it is easy to be mistaken on such a point.</p></div> </div>
