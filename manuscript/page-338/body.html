He got down from his window and he went off, either alone or with someone. That is sure.&rdquo;</p><p>I assented.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, now, let us turn to this unfortunate German master. The boy was fully dressed when he fled. Therefore, he foresaw what he would do. But the German went without his socks. He certainly acted on very short notice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did he go? Because, from his bedroom window, he saw the flight of the boy, because he wished to overtake him and bring him back. He seized his bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursuing him met his death.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
