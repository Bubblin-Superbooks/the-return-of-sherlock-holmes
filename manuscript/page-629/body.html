<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The professor is writing a learned book, and he found it necessary, about a year ago, to engage a secretary. The first two that he tried were not successes, but the third, Mr. Willoughby Smith, a very young man straight from the university, seems to have been just what his employer wanted. His work consisted in writing all the morning to the professor&rsquo;s dictation, and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day&rsquo;s work. This Willoughby Smith has nothing against him, either as a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at Cambridge. I have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a decent, quiet, hard-working fellow, with no weak spot in him at all. And yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the professor&rsquo;s study under circumstances which can point only to murder.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
