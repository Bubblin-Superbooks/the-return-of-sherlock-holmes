<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;good-morning. May I ask if you are very busy just now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not too busy to listen to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing particular on hand, you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case, which occurred only last night at Hampstead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A murder&mdash;a most dramatic and remarkable murder. I know how keen you are upon these things, and I would take it as a great favour if you would step down to Appledore Towers, and give us the benefit of your advice. It is no ordinary crime. We have had our eyes upon this Mr. Milverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of a villain. He is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes. These papers have all been burned by the murderers.</p></div> </div>
