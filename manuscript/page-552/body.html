<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have your letter here. You said, &lsquo;I desire to possess a copy of Devine&rsquo;s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession.&rsquo; Is that right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
