I can&rsquo;t say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so. &lsquo;I have had some very disagreeable associations in my life,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I wish to forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, for it is very painful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of, but you will have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when I became yours. If these conditions are too hard, then go back to Norfolk, and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.&rsquo; It was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I was content to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my word.</p></div> </div>
