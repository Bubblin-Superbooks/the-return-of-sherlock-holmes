<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is an amazing coincidence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected&mdash;must be connected. It is for us to find the connection.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But now the official police must know all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They know&mdash;and shall know&mdash;nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we know of both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against Lucas.</p></div> </div>
