<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;God bless you, Anna!&rdquo; murmured the old man again.</p><p>&ldquo;We were reformers&mdash;revolutionists&mdash;Nihilists, you understand. He and I and many more. Then there came a time of trouble, a police officer was killed, many were arrested, evidence was wanted, and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward, my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions. Yes, we were all arrested upon his confession. Some of us found our way to the gallows, and some to Siberia. I was among these last, but my term was not for life. My husband came to England with his ill-gotten gains and has lived in quiet ever since, knowing well that if the Brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
