He was for ever making eyes at me&mdash;a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. I thought that he was perfectly hateful&mdash;and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me to know such a person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Cyril is his name!&rdquo; said Holmes, smiling.</p><p>The young lady blushed and laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Holmes, Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope to be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how did I get talking about him? What I wished to say was that Mr. Woodley was perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers, who was a much older man, was more agreeable.</p></div> </div>
