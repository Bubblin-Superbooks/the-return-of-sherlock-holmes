I assure you I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his business, and what was I to do? I put the price well within your means. You would not pay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you sent the letters to my husband, and he&mdash;the noblest gentleman that ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace&mdash;he broke his gallant heart and died. You remember that last night, when I came through that door, I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching. Yes, you never thought to see me here again, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face to face, and alone. Well, Charles Milverton, what have you to say?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
