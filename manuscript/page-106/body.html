<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all going wrong, Watson&mdash;all as wrong as it can go. I kept a bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other, and I much fear that British juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over Lestrade&rsquo;s facts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you go to Blackheath?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard. The father was away in search of his son. The mother was at home&mdash;a little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. Of course, she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt.</p></div> </div>
