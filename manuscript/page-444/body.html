I had lost my hold on Black Peter and was stranded in London without a shilling. There was only my trade left. I saw these advertisements about harpooners, and high wages, so I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me here. That&rsquo;s all I know, and I say again that if I killed Black Peter, the law should give me thanks, for I saved them the price of a hempen rope.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
