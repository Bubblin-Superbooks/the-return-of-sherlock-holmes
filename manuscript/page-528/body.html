<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How many had I? Three&mdash;two and one are three&mdash;two of Dr. Barnicot&rsquo;s, and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I don&rsquo;t. Yes, I do, though. Why, it&rsquo;s Beppo. He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I&rsquo;ve heard nothing of him since. No, I don&rsquo;t know where he came from nor where he went to. I had nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days before the bust was smashed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all we could reasonably expect from Morse Hudson,&rdquo; said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop.</p></div> </div>
