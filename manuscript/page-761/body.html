Holmes drew a note from his pocket, and read aloud:</p><p>Abbey Grange, Marsham, Kent, 3:30 A.M. MY DEAR MR. HOLMES:</p><p>I should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case. It is something quite in your line. Except for releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept exactly as I have found it, but I beg you not to lose an instant, as it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there. Yours faithfully, STANLEY HOPKINS.</p></div> </div>
