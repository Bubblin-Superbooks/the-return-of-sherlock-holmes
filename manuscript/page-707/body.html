<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither was he a workingman. He was simply what the porter described as a &ldquo;medium-looking chap,&rdquo; a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale face, quietly dressed. He seemed himself to be agitated. The porter had observed his hand trembling when he had held out the note. Godfrey Staunton had crammed the note into his pocket. Staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall. They had exchanged a few sentences, of which the porter had only distinguished the one word &ldquo;time.&rdquo; Then they had hurried off in the manner described. It was just half-past ten by the hall clock.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Holmes, seating himself on Staunton&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;You are the day porter, are you not?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
