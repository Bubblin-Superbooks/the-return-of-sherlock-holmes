<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation and to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance when there was a step upon the stairs, and there was the heavy, stern, questioning face of Dr. Armstrong at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;So, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have attained your end and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion. I would not brawl in the presence of death, but I can assure you that if I were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Dr. Armstrong, I think we are a little at cross-purposes,&rdquo; said my friend, with dignity. &ldquo;If you could step downstairs with us, we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable affair.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
