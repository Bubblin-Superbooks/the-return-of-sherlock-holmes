<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Was the blind down?&rdquo; asked Holmes.</p><p>&ldquo;I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down. Yes, I remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. I could not find my stick, and he said, &lsquo;Never mind, my boy, I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until you come back to claim it.&rsquo; I left him there, the safe open, and the papers made up in packets upon the table. It was so late that I could not get back to Blackheath, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing more until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
