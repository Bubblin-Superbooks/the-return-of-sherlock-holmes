With his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;It must be very familiar to you. Have you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger? This empty house is my tree, and you are my tiger.
