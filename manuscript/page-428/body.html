<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Several letters were waiting for Holmes at Baker Street. He snatched one of them up, opened it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent, Watson! The alternative develops. Have you telegraph forms? Just write a couple of messages for me: &lsquo;Sumner, Shipping Agent, Ratcliff Highway. Send three men on, to arrive ten to-morrow morning.&mdash;Basil.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s my name in those parts. The other is: &lsquo;Inspector Stanley Hopkins, 46 Lord Street, Brixton. Come breakfast to-morrow at nine-thirty. Important. Wire if unable to come.&mdash;Sherlock Holmes.&rsquo; There, Watson, this infernal case has haunted me for ten days. I hereby banish it completely from my presence. To-morrow, I trust that we shall hear the last of it forever.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
