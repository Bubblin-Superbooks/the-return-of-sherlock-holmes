Well, it is a great responsibility that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint and if he can&rsquo;t avail himself of it I can do no more. See here, Captain Crocker, we&rsquo;ll do this in due form of law. You are the prisoner. Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one. I am the judge. Now, gentleman of the jury, you have heard the evidence.
