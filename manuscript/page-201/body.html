<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Holmes thought for a little, and then a curious smile played over his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Saddle a horse, my lad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall wish you to take a note to Elrige&rsquo;s Farm.&rdquo;</p><p>He took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. With these in front of him, he worked for some time at the study-table. Finally he handed a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him. I saw the outside of the note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike Holmes&rsquo;s usual precise hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney, Elriges Farm, East Ruston, Norfolk.</p></div> </div>
