<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I turned it over in my mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable, I have only to consider the question of personal risk. Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this, when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be in such a false position.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other possible way of regaining these letters. The unfortunate lady has not the money, and there are none of her people in whom she could confide. To-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night, this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin.</p></div> </div>
