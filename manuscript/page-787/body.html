In it lay some table linen and a large corkscrew.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite so. As a matter of fact, that screw was not used. This bottle was opened by a pocket screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more than an inch and a half long. If you will examine the top of the cork, you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted. It has never been transfixed. This long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it up with a single pull. When you catch this fellow, you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
