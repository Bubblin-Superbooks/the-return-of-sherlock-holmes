<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke&rsquo;s, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in town, I should have been at a loss what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,&rdquo; my friend answered. &ldquo;I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. When once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known as your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
