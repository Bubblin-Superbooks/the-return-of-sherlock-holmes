Such a thing has never happened during the many years that I have been here. I nearly fainted, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, it didn&rsquo;t matter to me where I sat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
