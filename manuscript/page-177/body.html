For two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence.

Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together.</p></div> </div>
